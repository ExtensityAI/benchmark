\section{Related Work}

The realm of symbolic AI traces its origins to seminal works such as the Logic Theorist (LT) \citep{Newell:56} and the General Problem Solver (GPS) \citep{Newell:57}. These pioneering programs embodied the inaugural attempts at automated reasoning and problem-solving via symbolic representations. However, despite representing milestones in AI, they encountered significant challenges when addressing the complexity intrinsic to real-world problems, chiefly the issue of combinatorial explosion. In an effort to surmount these challenges, the Soar cognitive architecture was conceived \citep{Laird:87}, building upon the concept that intelligent behavior emanates from a purposeful navigation through a problem spaceâ€”a notion proposed by \citep{Newell:72, McCarthy:06}. Each progression within this space involves the careful selection and application of various operators. Soar was a progressive stride, embedding elements such as reinforcement learning, impasses, substates, and chunking, to amplify its capacity for solving complex problems.
